Import the necessary package such as matplotlib to depict the plot of the given time series data.
Let us assume the given set of time series data t and X_t.
Calculate the trend component, seasonal component and the residual component.
These components can be calculated using for loop and if,elif and else conditions.
While using loops(i.e.,for) and conditions(i.e.,if, else and elif),append these components to ensure that no error can be generated.
Before calculating the seasonal component find the average seasonal component for the given data.
In the code len stands for the length of the time series data.
Before plotting these components mention the size of the figure which is to be plotted.
Use the matplotlib to plot the trend, seasonal and residual components and generate the required results.
Ensure that the plotting is done according to the given data.
