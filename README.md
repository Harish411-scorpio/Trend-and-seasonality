Import the necessary package such as matplotlib to depict the plot of the given time series data.
Let us assume the given set of time series data t and X_t.
Calculate the trend component, seasonal component and the residual component.
These components can be calculated using for loop and if,elif and else conditions.
In the code len stands for the length of the time series data.
Plot the trend, seasonal and residual components and generate the required results.
Before plotting these components mention the size of the figure which is to be plotted
